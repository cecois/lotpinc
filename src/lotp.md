ABOUT US
Danny
Danny used to own a plumbing business with his nephew, Bertand, who grew weary of Danny's personality and executed a hostile takeover in Winter 2008. Danny didn't get into drugs or Russian Roulette, instead bought a heavy coat at a Hollywood Nordstrom's and walked into the ocean where he invented Life of the Party, Inc. He swam ashore, shed the coat, and drove home. In July of 2009 he approached Scott Aukerman on Melrose Av in Hollywood and was invited on Comedy Bang! Bang! to plug LotP, launching his career in podcasting in addition to party rescue.

Bertrand
Bertand Mahoney is a dishonest and contentious fuckin mutt who currently operates a plumbing business that is, at best, tangentially-related to LotP.
